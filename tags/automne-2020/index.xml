      <title>Risk-neutral moments based estimation of continuous time jump-diffusion models</title>

      <description>Date: 4 décembre 2020 Heure: 15h00-16h00 Résumé: This paper provides a novel methodology for estimating option pricing models based on risk‐neutral moments. We synthesize the distribution extracted from a panel of option prices and exploit linear relationships between risk‐neutral cumulants and latent factors within the continuous time affine stochastic volatility framework. We find that fitting the Andersen et al. (Journal of Financial Economics, 2015, 117(3), 558–584) option valuation model to risk‐neutral moments captures the bulk of the information in option prices.</description>

      <description>Date: 23 octobre 2020 Heure: 15h00-16h00 Résumé: We undertake a large-scale empirical examination of systemic risk among 1048 financial institutions in a large sample of 23 emerging markets, broken down into 5 regions. This work extends the large literature on systemic risk in the US, Europe, and other developed countries to emerging markets, which is relatively under-researched. We present a novel systemic risk score for each financial system by region, across time.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Post-Disruption Response Operations to Improve Resilience of Critical Infrastructure Systems</title>
      <link>https://HECSciencesDecision.github.io/post/a2020/2020-10-16/</link>

      <description>Date: 16 octobre 2020 Heure: 15h00 – 16h00 Résumé: Critical infrastructure systems (CIS) underpin almost every aspect of the modern society by enabling the essential functions through overlaying service networks. After a disruption impacting the CIS, the functionality of the overlaying service networks degrades. Thus, after an extreme event, in order to minimize the negative impact to society, it is crucial to restore the disrupted CIS as soon as possible. In this talk, we focus on disruptions created by natural hazards on transportation CIS and develop methods to efficiently plan the post-disaster response operations.</description>

      <title>The Use of Binary Choice Forests to Model and Estimate Discrete Choices</title>
      <link>https://HECSciencesDecision.github.io/post/a2020/2020-10-09/</link>

      <description>Date: 9 octobre 2020 Heure: 15h00-16h00 Résumé: We show the equivalence of discrete choice models and the class of binary choice forests, which are random forests based on binary choice trees. This suggests that standard machine learning techniques based on random forests can serve to estimate discrete choice models with an interpretable output. This is confirmed by our data-driven theoretical results which show that random forests can predict the choice probability of any discrete choice model consistently, with its splitting criterion capable of recovering preference rank lists.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Causal Inference</title>

      <description>Date: 11 septembre 2020 Heure: 16h00-17h00 Résumé: Given advances in machine learning over the past decades, it is now possible to accurately solve difficult non-parametric prediction problems in a way that is routine and reproducible. In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how machine learning tools can be rigorously integrated into observational study analyses, and how they interact with classical statistical ideas around randomization, semiparametric modeling, double robustness, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ll also survey some recent advances in methods for treatment heterogeneity.</description>
