      <title>Optimizing Post-Disruption Response Operations to Improve Resilience of Critical Infrastructure Systems</title>

      <description>Date: 16 octobre 2020 Heure: 15h00 – 16h00 Résumé: Critical infrastructure systems (CIS) underpin almost every aspect of the modern society by enabling the essential functions through overlaying service networks. After a disruption impacting the CIS, the functionality of the overlaying service networks degrades. Thus, after an extreme event, in order to minimize the negative impact to society, it is crucial to restore the disrupted CIS as soon as possible. In this talk, we focus on disruptions created by natural hazards on transportation CIS and develop methods to efficiently plan the post-disaster response operations.</description>

      <title>The Use of Binary Choice Forests to Model and Estimate Discrete Choices</title>

      <description>Date: 9 octobre 2020 Heure: 15h00-16h00 Résumé: We show the equivalence of discrete choice models and the class of binary choice forests, which are random forests based on binary choice trees. This suggests that standard machine learning techniques based on random forests can serve to estimate discrete choice models with an interpretable output. This is confirmed by our data-driven theoretical results which show that random forests can predict the choice probability of any discrete choice model consistently, with its splitting criterion capable of recovering preference rank lists.</description>

      <description>Date: 11 septembre 2020 Heure: 16h00-17h00 Résumé: Biographie du conférencier: Stefan Wager is an assistant professor of Operations, Information, and Technology at Stanford University. He completed a PhD in statistics at the same university in 2016 with Brad Efron and Guenther Walther, and spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University. His research focuses on adapting ideas from machine learning to statistical problems that arise in scientific applications. His research interests are broad anc include causal inference, non-parametric statistics, uses of subsampling for data analysis, and empirical Bayes methods.</description>
