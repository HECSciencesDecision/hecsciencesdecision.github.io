2022-10-14,Frédéric Vrins,Optimal and robust combination of forecasts via constrained optimization and shrinkage,"A22, Quantact","We introduce various methods that combine forecasts using constrained optimization with penalty. A non-negativity constraint is imposed on the weights, and several penalties are considered, taking the form of a divergence from a reference combination scheme. In contrast with most of the existing approaches, our framework performs forecast selection and combination in one step, allowing for potentially sparse combining schemes. Moreover, by exploiting the analogy between forecasts combination and portfolio optimization, we provide the analytical expression of the optimal penalty strength when penalizing with the L2-divergence from the equally-weighted scheme. An extensive simulation study and two empirical applications allow us to investigate the impact of the divergence function, the reference scheme, and the non-negativity constraint on the predictive performance. Our results suggest that the proposed models outperform those considered in previous studies.",15h00,St-Hubert,https://sites.google.com/view/fredericvrins,"Frédéric Vrins a obtenu un PhD de l'École polytechnique de Louvain (UCLouvain) en 2007 dans le domaine du traitement de signaux adaptifs.

2022-10-28,Derek Bingham,Computer Model Emulation Using Deep Gaussian Processes,"A22, Statlab","Computer models are often used to explore physical systems. Increasingly, there are cases where the model is fast, the code is not readily accessible to scientists, but a large suite of model evaluations is available. In these cases, an ""emulator"" is used to stand in for the computer model. This work was motivated by a simulator for the chirp mass of binary black hole mergers where no output is observed for large portions of the input space and more than $10^6$ simulator evaluations are available. This poses two problems: (i) the need to address the discontinuity when observing no chirp mass; and (ii) performing statistical inference with a large number of simulator evaluations. The traditional approach for emulation is to use a stationary Gaussian process (GP) because it provides a foundation for uncertainty quantification for deterministic systems. We explore the impact of the choices when setting up the deep GP on posterior inference, apply the proposed approach to the real application and propose a sequential design approach for identifying new simulations.",15h30,Hélène-Desmarais,http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~dbingham/,"Derek Bingham est professeur titulaire et directeur du département de statistique et de sciences actuarielles de l'Université Simon Fraser à Vancouver, où il a complété en 1999 un doctorat en statistique sous la gouverne de Randy Sitter.

2022-11-02,Marie Lambert,Employee Views of Leveraged Buy-Out Transactions,"A22, finance, Quantact","This paper offers a comprehensive view of employee satisfaction: we make use of 700,000 ratings, in addition to 500,000 written reviews posted by employees of all ranks, in different industries, types of companies, and in companies that underwent different types of ownership changes. Employee satisfaction is lower following a company acquisition; more so when it is a Leveraged Buy-Out (LBO). However, there is significant heterogeneity. Our first key finding is that previous ownership type is the main source of heterogeneity for employee satisfaction. A large decrease is observed for Public-to-Private transactions only. The employee drop in satisfaction in these types of transactions is four times larger than in a traditional M&A. We do not find however any difference between Private-to-Private transactions and regular M&As. We conducted a Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis on about 500,000 written cons reviews and show that for Public-to-Private transactions, employees complain specifically about layoffs, restructuring and cost cutting as well as about the management team. However, these employees also complain less about the operations or their benefits which were a problem before the transaction.",12h00,Serge-Saucier,https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/fr/repertoire?uid=U193807,"Marie Lambert has a joint Ph.D. in Finance from the Universities of Liège and Luxembourg (2010).

2022-11-11,Roxana Dumitrescu,Optimal stopping mean-field games: a linear programming formulation and applications to entry-exit games in electricity markets,A22,"In this talk, we present recent results on the linear programming approach to stopping mean-field games in a general setting. This relaxed control approach allows to prove existence results under weak assumptions, and lends itself well to numerical implementation. We consider mean-field game problems where the representative agent chooses the optimal time to exit the game, where the instantaneous reward function and the coefficients of the state process may depend on the distribution of the other agents. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence between mean-field games equilibria obtained by the linear programming approach and the ones obtained via other approaches used in the previous literature. We then present a fictious play algorithm to approximate the mean-field game population dynamics in the context of the linear programming approach. Finally, we give an application of the theoretical and numerical contributions introduced in the first part of the talk to an entry-exit game in electricity markets.

2022-11-25,Rebecca Steorts,(Almost) All of Entity Resolution,"A22, Statlab","Whether the goal is to estimate the number of people that live in a congressional district, to estimate the number of individuals that have died in an armed conflict, or to disambiguate individual authors using bibliographic data, all these applications have a common theme — integrating information from multiple sources. Before such questions can be answered, databases must be cleaned and integrated in a systematic and accurate way, commonly known as record linkage, de-duplication, or entity resolution. In this article, we review motivational applications and seminal papers that have led to the growth of this area. Specifically, we review the foundational work that began in the 1940’s and 50’s that have led to modern probabilistic record linkage. We review clustering approaches to entity resolution, semi- and fully supervised methods, and canonicalization, which are being used throughout industry and academia in applications such as human rights, official statistics, medicine, citation networks, among others. Finally, we discuss current research topics of practical importance.

2022-12-06,Courtney Paquette,Stochastic Algorithms in the Large,A22,"In this talk, I will present a framework, inspired by random matrix theory, for analyzing the dynamics of stochastic optimization algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and momentum (SGD + M)) when both the number of samples and dimensions are large. Using this new framework, we show that the dynamics of optimization algorithms on a least squares problem with random data become deterministic in the large sample and dimensional limit. In particular, the limiting dynamics for stochastic algorithms are governed by a Volterra equation. From this model, we identify a stability measurement, the implicit conditioning ratio (ICR), which regulates the ability of SGD+M to accelerate the algorithm. When the batch size exceeds this ICR, SGD+M converges linearly at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{\kappa})$, matching optimal full-batch momentum (in particular performing as well as a full-batch but with a fraction of the size). For batch sizes smaller than the ICR, in contrast, SGD+M has rates that scale like a multiple of the single batch SGD rate. We give explicit choices for the learning rate and momentum parameter in terms of the Hessian spectra that achieve this performance. Finally we show this model matches performances on real data sets.",10h00,Hélène-Desmarais,https://cypaquette.github.io/,"Courtney Paquette est professeur adjointe à l’université McGill et détentrice d’une chaire en IA Canada.

2023-02-24,Gah-Yi Ban,Personalized Dynamic Pricing with Machine Learning: High Dimensional Features and Heterogeneous Elasticity,"H23, Zoom","We consider a seller who can dynamically adjust the price of a product at the individual customer level, by utilizing information about customers’ characteristics encoded as a $d$-dimensional feature vector. We assume a personalized demand model, parameters of which depend on $s$ out of the $d$ features. The seller initially does not know the relationship between the customer features and the product demand, but learns this through sales observations over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. We prove that the seller’s expected regret, i.e., the revenue loss against a clairvoyant who knows the underlying demand relationship, is at least of order $s\sqrt{T}$% under any admissible policy. We then design a near-optimal pricing policy for a “semi-clairvoyant” seller (who knows which $s$ of the $d$ features are in the demand model) that achieves an expected regret of order $s\sqrt{T}\log T$. We extend this policy to a more realistic setting where the seller does not know the true demand predictors, and show that this policy has an expected regret of order $s\sqrt{T} (\log d＋\log T)$, which is also near-optimal. Finally, we test our theory on simulated data and on a data set from an online auto loan company in the United States. On both data sets, our experimentation-based pricing policy is superior to intuitive and/or widely-practiced customized pricing methods such as myopic pricing and segment-then-optimize policies. Furthermore, our policy improves upon the loan company’s historical pricing decisions by 47% in expected revenue over a six-month period.",10h00,Zoom,https://www.gahyiban.com/,"Dr. Gah-Yi Ban est professeur aggrégée à l’école de gestion de Imperial College à Londres et anciennement de la London Business School et de l’Université du Maryland.
