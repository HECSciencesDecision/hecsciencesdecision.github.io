She joined the ORIE faculty after serving as the Harvey E. Wagner Endowed Chair Professor at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Lehigh University. She was also a co-director of Lehigh Institute on Data, Intelligent Systems and Computation. Professor Scheinberg was born in Moscow, Russia, and earned her undergraduate degree in operations research from the Lomonosov Moscow State University in 1992 and then received her Ph.D. in operations research from Columbia in 1997. She was a research staff member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center for over a decade, where she worked on various applied and theoretical problems in optimization."
2023-02-24,Gah-Yi Ban,Personalized Dynamic Pricing with Machine Learning: High Dimensional Features and Heterogeneous Elasticity,"H23, Zoom","We consider a seller who can dynamically adjust the price of a product at the individual customer level, by utilizing information about customers’ characteristics encoded as a $d$-dimensional feature vector. We assume a personalized demand model, parameters of which depend on $s$ out of the $d$ features. The seller initially does not know the relationship between the customer features and the product demand, but learns this through sales observations over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. We prove that the seller’s expected regret, i.e., the revenue loss against a clairvoyant who knows the underlying demand relationship, is at least of order $s\sqrt{T}$% under any admissible policy. We then design a near-optimal pricing policy for a “semi-clairvoyant” seller (who knows which $s$ of the $d$ features are in the demand model) that achieves an expected regret of order $s\sqrt{T}\log T$. We extend this policy to a more realistic setting where the seller does not know the true demand predictors, and show that this policy has an expected regret of order $s\sqrt{T} (\log d＋\log T)$, which is also near-optimal. Finally, we test our theory on simulated data and on a data set from an online auto loan company in the United States. On both data sets, our experimentation-based pricing policy is superior to intuitive and/or widely-practiced customized pricing methods such as myopic pricing and segment-then-optimize policies. Furthermore, our policy improves upon the loan company’s historical pricing decisions by 47% in expected revenue over a six-month period.",10h00,Zoom,https://www.gahyiban.com/,"Dr. Gah-Yi Ban est professeur agrégée à l’école de gestion de Imperial College à Londres et anciennement de la London Business School et de l’Université du Maryland.
