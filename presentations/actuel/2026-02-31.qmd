# Résumé

We examine how financial sophistication influences investment outcomes for complex financial products. Using regulatory microdata from Brazil’s structured products market, we analyze how returns vary with investor sophistication and product complexity. We introduce a novel measure of financial sophistication that reflects prior trading experience in other securities markets. Investors with established trading experience systematically outperform inexperienced counterparts when trading complex products, exhibiting both persistent skill and greater learning capabilities. This experience-based measure is more predictive than conventional proxies such as wealth, age, and education. Our findings suggest that complexity can effectively obscure risk from unsophisticated investors, enabling strategic rent extraction through product design. These results question the efficacy of current “qualified investor” standards based on wealth thresholds, suggesting that direct measures of financial market experience provide more effective criteria for accessing complex financial instruments in increasingly sophisticated retail markets.
