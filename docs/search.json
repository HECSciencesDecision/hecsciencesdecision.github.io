    "text": "Résumé\nWe study partial information Nash equilibrium between a broker and an informed trader. In this model, the informed trader, who possesses knowledge of a trading signal, trades multiple assets with the broker in a dealer market. Simultaneously, the broker trades these assets in a lit exchange where their actions impact the asset prices. The broker, however, only observes aggregate prices and cannot distinguish between underlying trends and volatility. Both the broker and the informed trader aim to maximize their penalized expected wealth. Using convex analysis, we characterize the Nash equilibrium and demonstrate its existence and uniqueness. Furthermore, we establish that this equilibrium corresponds to the solution of a nonstandard system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) that involves the two differing filtrations. For short enough time horizons, we prove that the solution of this system exists. Moreover, we show that the solution to the FBSDE system may be approximated by a power series in the strength of the transient impact to arbitrary order and prove that the error is controlled. If time permits, I will also discuss a new deep learning approach for approximating the solution to the system of FBSDEs.\n\n\nBiographie\nDr Sebastian Jaimungal is a full professor of mathematical finance and the chair of the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.

    "title": "An Extended Validity Domain for Constraint Learning",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Résumé\nWe consider embedding a (predictive) machine-learning model within a (prescriptive) optimization problem. In this setting, called constraint learning, the computed optimal solution may be too far from the training data, that is, in a region where the machine-learning predictions are less accurate. To correct for this, researchers have proposed the concept of a validity domain, which further constrains the optimization to stay close to the training data. One common choice forces the decision variable to lie within the convex hull of the data. In this talk, we propose a new validity domain, which uses the convex-hull idea in an extended space. We investigate its properties and compare it empirically with existing techniques on a set of test problems for which the ground-truth optimization problem is known. We also consider our approach within a pricing case study using real-world data. This is joint work with Yilin Zhu at the University of Iowa.\n\n\nBiographie\nSam Burer is the Tippie Rollins Professor in the Department of Business Analytics at the University of Iowa.
