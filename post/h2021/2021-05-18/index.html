<h2 id="résumé">Résumé:</h2>
<p>Despite reproducibility concerns in science, an increased awareness of the prevalence of statistical errors in life sciences research, and even a tightening up of quantitative reporting standards in journals, statistical errors continue to permeate life sciences research. Yet, life science students often only need to take one Statistics course in their undergraduate programs, if that. What can we, as educators, do to prepare future life scientists for statistical practice in research when we have such limited time with them?</p>
<p>In a collaboration between the Department of Statistical Sciences and the Human Biology Program at the University of Toronto, a second-year undergraduate course was introduced a few years ago to integrate statistics instruction with research design to improve the quantitative training of life sciences students. A study was conducted in this course to explore students’ perceptions about statistical practice in the life sciences and their preparedness use statistical methods appropriately in research. Student attitudes and self-efficacies for Statistics, as well as their abilities to recognize and handle problems related to statistical practice in life sciences research was assessed by way of surveys administered at the beginning and end of the course. In this talk, I will highlight this course, share key findings of the study, and reflect on how the results can help inform future course offerings and training initiatives to better prepare our students to effectively engage with Statistics in research.</p>
<h2 id="biographie-des-conférenciers">Biographie des conférenciers:</h2>
<p>Dr. Bethany White is an Associate Professor, Teaching Stream in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto. She is currently Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies in Statistics. She received a M.Math degree and a PhD in biostatistics from the University of Waterloo. While an assistant professor at the University of Western Ontario, she received a Faculty of Science Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching.</p>
<p>Bethany White’s research interests involve the impact of technology-enhanced and simulation activities on student learning and attitudes toward statistics. She also has pedagogical interest in the quantitative preparation of students to effectively engage with statistics in life sciences research. She serves on Statistical Society of Canada (SSC) committees and with the editorial team of the American Statistical Society&rsquo;s Journal of Statistics Education (JSE), and has served on organizing committees for statistics and science education workshops and conferences in Canada and the US.</p>
