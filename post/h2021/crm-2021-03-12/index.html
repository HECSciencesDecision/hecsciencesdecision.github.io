<p>Informative selection, in which the distribution of response variables given that they are sampled is different from their distribution in the population, is pervasive in complex surveys.  Failing to take such informativeness into account can produce severe inferential errors, including biased and inconsistent estimation of population parameters.  While several parametric procedures exist to test for informative selection, these methods are limited in scope and their parametric assumptions are difficult to assess.  We consider two classes of nonparametric tests of informative selection.  The first class is motivated by classic nonparametric two-sample tests.  We compare weighted and unweighted empirical distribution functions and obtain tests for informative selection that are analogous to Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-von Mises.  For the second class of tests, we adapt a kernel-based learning method that compares distributions based on their maximum mean discrepancy.  The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics are established under the null hypothesis of noninformative selection.  Simulation results show that our tests have power competitive with existing parametric tests in a correctly specified parametric setting, and better than those tests under model misspecification.  A recreational angling application illustrates the methodology.</p>

<p>F. Jay Breidt is Full Professor and interim Chair of the Department of Statistics at Colorado State University. His expertise is in survey sampling, time series, nonparametric regression, and uncertainty quantification for complex scientific models. He received his PhD at Colorado State University in 1991 and spent the first nine years of his career at Iowa State University as an assistant professor and tenured associate professor, before returning to Colorado State in 2000. Breidt has produced over 90 refereed papers and has presented over 130 invited short courses, conference talks, and academic seminars. Since 1991, his research has been supported continuously by a variety of agencies including the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency, US Forest Service, and NASA.</p>
